		<h1> The Story in the Book </h1>
		<h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
		<p> Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now.
		On her desk, lying between the copies of <i> Nature</i>, <i> New Scientist </i>,
		 and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of
		 <cite> On The Road </cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the 
		 longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
		<p>
		She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.
		Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something
		better to do.

        <p>There are around 10,000 living species of birds
            that inhabit different ecosystems from the
            Arctic to the Antarctic. Many species undertake
            long distance annual migrations, and many more
            perform shorter irregular journeys.</p>
